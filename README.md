# Simple Todo Service

A simple backend service for managing to-do list operations.

The service supports basic CRUD operations such as creating, updating, and retrieving to-do items.

---

## Assumptions

- The system is **single-user** and does not support user-based to-do items.
- Authentication and authorization are intentionally **not implemented**, as per requirements.
- All timestamps are handled in **UTC**.
- The dataset is expected to be small (no pagination or archiving required).
